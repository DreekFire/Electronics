Maxwell Pointer
Using a smartphone magnetometer to track a magnetic stylus in 3D space

Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a compact, pen-like object which can be located in space with the use of the sensors available to a common smartphone. This could be used to expand the touchscreen onto any flat surface, providing an alternative to SMARTboards or whiteboards when used in conjunction with a projector and also providing a more comfortable workflow for artists and designers. It could also be used as a 3D pen for use in sculpting or virtual and augmented reality. In addition, the phone could send the information wirelessly to a computer to be used in applications that are unavailable on mobile devices.
Technical Details
Each orthogonal electromagnet will be represented as a magnetic dipole moment. This approximation increases in accuracy as the distance between the sensor and the coil increases. Absolute accuracy is not as important in our application, as the pen is being manipulated by a human who can use their senses to adjust. Increased accuracy could be useful to allow the pen to be used to trace 3D objects, however.
Each of three coils is powered by AC at a different frequency. We use the Fourier transform to extract the energy of the signal at each of those three frequencies. Then, we use an iterative least-squares process to find a relative pose for the pens which would produce that signal.

Design
	The pen will be made from three orthogonal coils wrapped around an iron core. These coils will be driven by three AC signals of different frequencies. We will use the fourier transform to extract the amplitude at each frequency along each axis of the magnetometer in each slice in time. This will provide nine readings: three axes multiplied by three waves. As we only have six variables, three for translation and three for rotation, only two non-parallel coils are theoretically needed, but we choose to include a third, as well as make all the coils orthogonal to each other, in order to maximize accuracy.
	As we are interested in the pose of the tip of the pen, the coil should be placed as close to it as possible since error in rotation will be multiplied by the distance from the coil to the tip. The most comfortable position available while still resembling a pen is right behind the fingers, such as in a pencil grip.
	The remaining electrical components will be placed in the barrel of the pen. Placing the components within the pen both increases portability and reduces the interference generated by current flowing through wires outside of the coils.
